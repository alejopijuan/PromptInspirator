# PromptInspirator

PromptInspirator is a practical tool overlaid on top of Stable Diffusion to add richness to your prompts by giving suggestions and inspiration for descriptors that help make your imagined prompts more alive.
We leverage a BERT base model for relevant descriptors prediction, Stable Diffusion v1.4 for image generation, and the Flair library for POS tagging.
